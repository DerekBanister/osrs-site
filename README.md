# OSRS Site

* This website is a personal project. It is a simple website using a OSRS-JSON-Hiscores NPM package to retrieve statistics for a video game called Old School Runescape. It pulls the searched players boss killcounts and their skill levels. There is also a seperate page for the top 25 players in Old School Runescape.

* Note: CORS is a massive headache, huge shoutout to [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) for their npm package.
